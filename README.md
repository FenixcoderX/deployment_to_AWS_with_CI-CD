# Deployment to AWS with CI/CD

AWS (CLI, S3, RDS, Elastic Beanstalk) | CircleCI | GitHub

In this project, the full-stack application is deployed to a cloud service provider AWS. The AWS console is utilized to start and configure the necessary services for the application, including a database for storing user information and a web server for enabling user discovery of the site.
Additionally, a CI/CD pipeline is implemented with CircleCI linked to the project on GitHub, facilitating automatic deployment of the website to AWS.


The project also includes documentation and runbooks covering the operations of the deployment process:
